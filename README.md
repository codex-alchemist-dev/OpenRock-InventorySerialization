# OpenRock-InventorySerialization

Round-trips a real Bedrock ItemStack (durability, enchantments, name, lore) to/from plain JSON, since ItemStack objects can't be stored directly as dynamic-property data.

Part of the [OpenRock](https://github.com/codex-alchemist-dev/OpenRock) Minecraft Bedrock mod-packaging ecosystem - a Codex Alchemist project, under Fireball Everything. Consumed as a real git submodule at `libs/inventory-serialization` in the main OpenRock repo, and directly `npm require`/`import`-able (real top-level CommonJS exports, esbuild-CJS/ESM-interop-compatible) by any mod's own build-time kernel registration or real in-game script.
